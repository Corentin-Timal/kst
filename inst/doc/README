INSTALLING RGRAPHVIZ UNDER WINDOWS (current as of November 19th, 2011)
======================================================================

In order to make use of the plotting functionalities provided in the 
kst-package, the package 'Rgraphviz' is required. While stable under 
other operating systems, when run on a Windows machine Rgraphviz 
requires some extra work to operate properly.

One way to ensure proper operation is to compile Rgraphviz from source. 
If you prefer this option please see the README of the Rgraphviz-
package for details.

In case you prefer to use the Rgraphviz Windows binaries the 
following suggestions have proven helpful:



Installing Rgraphviz under Windows 32bit
----------------------------------------

The README of the Rgraphviz-package provides a detailed description of 
how to install Rgraphviz on 32bit Windows systems. A brief summary is 
given here:

- Install Graphviz 2.20.3.1 Windows binary distribution from
  http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/stable/windows/graphviz-2.20.3.1.msi
  Note that it is vital to use this particular version of Graphviz.

- Add Graphviz' bin diretory to the user PATH environment variable.

- Install the Rgraphviz-package from Bioconductor.



Installing Rgraphviz under Windows 64bit
----------------------------------------

The Graphviz version 2.20.3.1 used for 32bit systems does not work on 
64bit machines. Consequently, a 64bit Graphviz version is needed:

- Download the 64bit Graphviz version from 
  http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/goodies/Win64No_/
  and extract the archive to a folder on your computer.

- Change the PATH environment variable to point to the location of 
  the Graphviz64 bin directory.

- Install the 64bit Rgraphviz-binary from Bioconductor.

For obvious reasons the 64bit Graphviz und Rgraphviz versions only work 
when used in combination with the 64bit R version.



If you still encounter problems please refer to the Rgraphviz-README.
