Note that the plot method in package kst makes use of the package Rgraphviz. 
Rgraphviz v1.18 or higher may cause problems on Windows operating systems. 
For this reason, Rgraphviz v1.16.0 is provided in the /pkgs directory 
of this package and may be installed manually in case of plotting errors.
